LeNet architecture was proposed in 1998. You may read the paper here: http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf

The architecture consists of:
1. Two Convolution Layers
2. Two Sub-sampling Layers
3. Three Fully Connected Layers (FCL)

In this folder, you will see various implementations (in both PyTorch and Keras) of LeNet architecture achieving very high accuracy in classification task.
