This repository contains everything I have learned in Image processing and computer vision. 

If you are new to this field and are interested in climbing up the ladder from the basics, please start with the "Image processing.ipynb" file. I have tried to make it as comprehensive as possible. Please let me know if there are any suggestions. 

If you are an experienced practitioner and are here to review, you may also start your review from the same file. The other files are minor projects, which are too basic to have their own repositories, but too important to have their existence removed after being deleted from my local machine/drive.
